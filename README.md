Hi, I'm Ian. I'm a fifth year graduate student at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience (CMBN), Rutgers University - Newark, in Dr. Denis Pare's lab. My other mentor is Dr. Drew Headley.

<br />

interests:

- neuroscience (molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral, cognitive, network, computational ..)
- philosophy (of science, of mind)
- critical thinking and logic
- animals (rats, bunnies, birbs, cats, doggos, people ..), plants, and social interactions


what I do at work: 

- work with rats
- anatomy and imaging
- electrophysiology
- data analysis (Matlab, Python, R ..)
- coordination of projects (working in teams)
- instruction and presentations (as TA and in lab)


goals:

- explain behavior and cognition as multi-scale emergent phenomena
- add to the literature on neural coding and communication
- become an armchair theoretical neuroscience person
