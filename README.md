With an anticipated PhD in Neuroscience this May, I am looking for opportunities to help develop embodied intelligence based on how brains efficiently produce intelligent thoughts and behaviors. I am eager to engage in learning and testing computational models that draw insights from brain sciences, aiming for practical breakthroughs.

I bring acumen honed from a decade of experience in: 

1) conducting psychophysics, behavioral, chemogenetic, and neurophysiology experiments, 
2) interpreting and contextualizing results, 
3) troubleshooting and designing experiments, and 
4) managing mental health patients as well as labs. 

I often wore multiple hats as mentee, mentor, coordinator, and leader in four different research settings across three institutions. My research experience spans from animal to human clinical models in neuroscience and psychology.

I am comfortable presenting to both field experts and the public (refer to Honors & awards section in the link below). I have taught multiple introductory to upper level psychology and neuroscience courses, serving as a teaching assistant with recitation responsibilities and as an adjunct instructor where I assisted in managing courses with enrollments exceeding 100 or 200 students. 

I am dedicated to fostering community and individual growth. My priorities include accountability, timely project completion, proactive goal-setting, and interdisciplinary problem-solving, all grounded in critical thinking and tailored communication.

Thanks for stopping by! I look forward to connecting with you, hopefully we are a good fit.
