I am looking for two kinds of opportunities, ideally one that encompasses both. One is to communicate science. The other is to test different computational models that are firmly grounded in biology, capitalizing on the constraints and insights from brain sciences, aimed at practical breakthroughs like reducing the amount of energy used to train and employ these models. 

My research experience spans from animal to human clinical models in neuroscience and psychology. I am comfortable presenting to both field experts and the public, and have strong reviews teaching subjects in these topics. I have created tasks, tests, and conducted analyses and statistical tests using Python, Matlab, and R during this time. 

For a three minute summary of my PhD thesis work please check out this video (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iantkim_here-is-a-3-min-video-summary-of-my-phd-activity-7179429124782854144-08pp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

I bring acumen honed from a decade of experience in: 

1) conducting psychophysics, eye-tracking, behavioral, chemogenetic, and neurophysiology experiments
2) interpreting and contextualizing results
3) troubleshooting and designing experiments
4) managing mental health patients (from adolescents at high risk of developing schizophrenia to older Alzheimer's patients) as well as labs
5) wearing multiple hats as mentee, mentor, coordinator, and leader in four different research settings across three institutions

I am dedicated to fostering community and individual growth. My priorities include accountability, timely project completion, proactive goal-setting, and interdisciplinary problem-solving, all grounded in critical thinking and tailored communication.

Thanks for stopping by! I look forward to connecting with you, hopefully we are a good fit.
