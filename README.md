Hi, I'm Ian. I'm a fifth year graduate student at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience (CMBN), Rutgers University - Newark, in Dr. Denis Pare's lab. My other mentor is Dr. Drew Headley.   <insert something interesting/funny/witty/light (crowdsourcing this) here>

<br />

current interests:

- neuroscience (molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral, cognitive, network, computational ..)
- philosophy (of science, of mind)
- critical thinking and logic
- great explanations
- animals (rats, bunnies, squirrels, birbs, Cat., doggos, humanity ..), plants, and social interactions
- better living wage


what I do at work: 

- troubleshooting at all levels of lab work
- work with (cute) rats
- anatomy and imaging
- in vivo electrophysiology
- surgery (viruses/tracers and electrodes)
- data analysis (mainly using Matlab, Python, R ..)
- coordination of projects (working in teams with varying responsibilities/mentoring)
- instruction and presentations (as TA in classes and in lab)
- advocate for better living wage

what I do outside of work:

- work on getting a better living wage via other lines of income so I don't have to worry about money and keep bothering (read: contribute) other scientists
