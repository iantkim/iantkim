Hi, I'm Ian. I'm a fifth year graduate student at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience (CMBN), Rutgers University - Newark, in Dr. Denis Pare's lab. My other mentor is Dr. Drew Headley.   <insert something interesting/funny/witty/light (crowdsourcing this) here>

<br />

current interests:

- neuroscience (neural coding and communication in general)
- philosophy (of science, of mind)
- critical thinking and logic
- great explanations
- animals (rats, bunnies, squirrels, birbs, Cat., doggos, humanity ..), plants, and social interactions


stuff I do at work: 

- produce and learn and help and produce and get help and ..
- work with (cute) rats
- anatomy and imaging
- in vivo electrophysiology
- rodent surgery (viruses/tracers and electrodes)
- data analysis (mainly using Matlab, Python and R when I have to)
- coordination of projects (work in teams with varying responsibilities/mentoring)
- instruction and presentations (as TA in classes and in lab)

what I do outside of work:

- work on getting a better living wage via alternative lines of income so I don't have to worry about money which will help me keep bothering other scientists to provide answers to my inquiries
