I am looking for opportunities to test different computational models that are firmly grounded in biology, capitalizing on the constraints and insights from brain sciences, aimed at practical breakthroughs. 

My research experience spans from animal to human clinical models in neuroscience and psychology. I am comfortable presenting to both field experts and the public, and have strong reviews teaching subjects in these topics. I have created tasks, tests, and ran analyses and statistical tests using Python, Matlab, and R during this time. 

I bring acumen honed from a decade of experience in: 

1) conducting psychophysics, behavioral, chemogenetic, and neurophysiology experiments
2) interpreting and contextualizing results
3) troubleshooting and designing experiments
4) managing mental health patients (from adolescents at high risk of developing schizophrenia to older Alzheimer's patients) as well as labs
5) wearing multiple hats as mentee, mentor, coordinator, and leader in four different research settings across three institutions

I am dedicated to fostering community and individual growth. My priorities include accountability, timely project completion, proactive goal-setting, and interdisciplinary problem-solving, all grounded in critical thinking and tailored communication.

Thanks for stopping by! I look forward to connecting with you, hopefully we are a good fit.
